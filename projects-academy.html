                            <blockquote><strong>Purpose: to deliver the education strategy</strong> <br><br><em>All our schools, including the think-tank, can be described as a colossal nexus populated by experts pooled from all over the Universe to deliver the best for all learners [participants] preparing for any examination or bent on acquiring a certain set of skills to do a particular project of service to self, community and society at large. Put simply, these centres of knowledge dissertation deliver ZIMSEC, CAMBRIDGE, HEXCO and OTHER syllabuses with distinction; with participants pursuing academic, technical and professional careers away from brick and mortar free from the limitations of time, distance and space.<br><br><strong>Scope</strong><br><br>
                            The “international” outlook of SAMPET INSTITUTIONS derives from the universal nature of its overall scope. The syllabuses addressed are drawn from a wide range of institutions in Zimbabwe, the SADC, and Africa and beyond. The online mode of deli<span id="dotss">...</span><span id="moree">very, by its nature, defies passport boundaries. Informed by the philosophical concept of “the sovereign individual”, the online methodology targets every global citizen, newly born, infant, adolescent, grown-up and ‘grown-out’ alike. This approach complements Klaus Schwab’s craving, which is shared by every global citizen: to ‘shape the future of the fourth industrial revolution’ and ensure that mankind benefits optimally from the digital capabilities and affordances of ICT.<br><br><strong>Context</strong><br><br>Born in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, the SAMPET UNIVERSE VISION is simply the future of education and lifelong training. It is not an enemy of conventional schools, colleges and/or universities. Far from it. Rather, it is the timely companion and coadjutor, offering an alternative and supplementary promotional digital/online platform and virtual rendezvous for scholars [participants] and course developers, teachers, lecturers, trainers, facilitators and consultants alike.<br><br><strong>Methodology</strong><br><br>The modus operandi of SAMPET INSITUTIONS is informed by the participatory methodology. It is fully conversational, iterative, proactive, retrospective and retro-active; and both synchronous and asynchronous. It makes use of ready-made resources prepared after official syllabuses; but the delivery of that content is disruptive, game-changing and unique; markedly different from the routine and religious pursuit of rigid timetables, rosters and deadlines. At SAMPET, even with these regular syllabus-bound courses, there are no deadlines. Yes, deadlines are dead and replaced with target timelines to allow flexibility to users (participants and facilitators). Hence learners register for what they critically need and can execute in the shortest time possible to cut down on costs in time and money.<br>To illustrate the doability of the above point, let us share the following example:<br>ZIMSEC O-Level English Language Course in ‘conventional’ parlance, say in Zimbabwe, runs for 4 years. Four years of studying skills to answer only five components, namely: free choice composition, situational composition (Paper 1), comprehension, summary and language structure (Paper 2). DOAI has done a background check and established that the actual number of months students learn in ‘conventional’ schools is at most 2 per a term of 4 months a year; thus effective learning takes place in 6 months of each year of the four years, with the rest of the time gobbled by holidays, formative and end-of-term assessments (examinations). What this implies directly is that ZIMSEC O-Level English Language Course is effectively doable in two full years even in the ‘conventional’ sense.<br>Given the above finding of fact, and supported by the flexible online methodology, DOAI has packaged the same course in a manner that makes an ambitious post-Grade 7 learner ready for the same examination in two years. Two years become the minimum threshold while the four years remain as maximum threshold. This way all learners of varying learning speeds are catered for. None is disadvantaged.To make this possible, learners are presented with a module for each component. A module free-choice composition skills, a module for situational composition skills, a module for comprehension skills, a module for summary skills, a module for register skills; and of course supporting assessment materials. The rest is history.<br>The above applies to all syllabus-bound courses which are delivered both on-time (live) and asynchronously. These are part of the proactive deliverables of SAMPET. But because prospective Learners have different needs, some of which may not have been proactively designed by SAMPET, prospective Learners are free to make use of our interactive portal (call centre) to ask for more. True, DOAI is never bereft of ideas. We may not have the appropriate expert on the spot, but our pool of experts is inexhaustible. The appropriate expert is timeously identified and hired for those in the hour of need. It is that simple. The content creation follows the same SAMPET template and quality is subsequently delivered to the doorstep of the Applicant[s].<br><br><strong>Methods delivery</strong><br><br>There are many online methods of delivery and learners have different favorites for different skill-sets; never mind their reasons. They therefore choose particular methods at different times for their own reasons and circumstances, again never mind those reasons and circumstances. A good milkman’s duty is to deliver quality milk. It is their democratic right to choose. For that reason, DOAI uses a wide range of methods including customized ones. Some of the methods enabled by SAMPET Online Platform and Microsoft 365 are:<br>•  Instructor-Led or Synchronistic [Zoom, skype and Microsoft Teams]<br>•  Self-Paced or Asynchronistic<br>•   Simulation or Scenario Based Training<br>•  Virtual Reality Training<br>•   On-the-job Training<br>•    Coaching & Mentoring<br>•   Blended Learning<br><br><strong>Online Activities</strong><br><br>Prescription is the biggest enemy of flexibility but obviously a better evil that outright chaos.<br><br>The activities that ensure safe delivery of skills to designed logical ends include:<br>•    Conversations [lectures]<br>•   Tutorials [one-on-one or group]<br>•    Individual student activities [assignments]<br>•    Student group activities [group assignments]<br>•   Webinars<br>•   Consultancies<br>•  Etc.<br><br><strong>Assessment</strong><br><br>Monitoring and Evaluation is the key to measuring the success of any effort. To all our prospective learners and participants, we say all our resource materials are insured with these fundamental assessment activities. Because of the skills-focus of our brand, all our resource materials are replete with evaluation activities. After every skills training session, what follows is evaluation of uptake through activities that speak to the assessment objectives of that particular course or syllabus. Assessment activities form the interface between Learner and Facilitator. All these activities are designed to be continuous and cumulative. And of course the subsequent feedback leaves room for the Learner to seek further guidance till we get there ‘together as one’.
