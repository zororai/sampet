                <p>Established in June 2021 by Dr Augustine Maruva[enyika] Tirivanga, SAMPET FAMILY TRUST is a family-based Trust built on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of poverty, alleviating the financial troubles of the immediate family born of Sam and Pet [the canonized Patriarch and Matriarch through the bloodline of their 8th Son, Augustine, hereby the Settlor] but also stretching to the larger community of the under-privileged,  giving them a chance to live a dignified life and measure of happiness; inspired by the tenets of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)</span>, The African Charter on the Rights of the African Child and the founding values of the Zimbabwean Constitution. Take note that the declaration and these charters may not be legally binding but carry moral weight because they have been adopted by the international community.<br><br>
                            The Universal Declaration of Human Rights begins by recognizing that &quot;the inherent dignity of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world&quot;. It declares that human rights are universal-to be enjoyed by all people, no matter who they are or where they live. It also includes economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to social security, health and education.<br><br>
                            Articles 1, 2 and 26 of the UDHR are particularly instructive to the founding principles of SAMPET FAMILY TRUST.<br><br><strong>Article 1 of the UDHR says:</strong><br>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.<span id="dotsss"></span><span id="moreee"><br><br><strong>Article 2 of the UDHR adds:</strong><br>Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs, whether it be independent, trust, non-self-governing or under any other limitation of sovereignty.<br><br><strong>Article 26 of the UDHR states:</strong><br>(1) Everyone has the right to education. Education shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages. Elementary education shall be compulsory. Technical and professional education shall be made generally available and higher education shall be equally accessible to all on the basis of merit.<br>(2) Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace.<br>(3) Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.<br>Closer home SAMPET FAMILY TRUST takes cue from the provisions of the African Charter on the Rights of the African Child; and of course from the founding values of the Zimbabwean Constitution. The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child is a regional human rights treaty adopted in 1990 and which came into force in 1999. It sets out rights and defines principles for the status of children, paying particular attention to the prevention of early child marriages and thus opening opportunities for them to pursue higher education and professional careers for optimal self-realization.<br><br><strong>On the same vein the Zimbabwean Constitution’s founding values are equally instructive. The Preamble captures them as follows:</strong><br>We the people of Zimbabwe, United in our diversity by our common desire for freedom, justice and equality, and our heroic resistance to colonialism, racism and all forms of domination and oppression, Reference to country's history Exalting and extolling the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives during the Chimurenga / Umvukela and national liberation struggles, Honouring our forebears and compatriots who toiled for the progress of our country, Recognising the need to entrench democracy, good, transparent and accountable governance and the rule of law, Reaffirming our commitment to upholding and defending fundamental human rights and freedoms, Acknowledging the richness of our natural resources, Celebrating the vibrancy of our traditions and cultures, Determined to overcome all challenges and obstacles that impede our progress, Cherishing freedom, equality, peace, justice, tolerance, prosperity and patriotism in search of new frontiers under a common destiny, Acknowledging the supremacy of Almighty God, in whose hands our future lies . . . Resolve by the tenets of this Constitution to commit ourselves to build a united, just and prosperous nation, founded on values of transparency, equality, freedom, fairness, honesty and the dignity of hard work.<br>The above values and ethics guide our grand march into the world, believing that united we can impact a new civilization for all humankind. We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of the underprivileged people across the world, with our charity beginning at home. We endeavor to provide the best quality services in empowering education, sustainable health delivery and social welfare free of cost to people living on the fringes of local and global economies.<br>Indeed, we strongly believe that our noble march into this grand project would not be possible without the generous support of our valuable development partners. We, therefore, look forward to game-changing, timely and disruptive interventions from our local and international development partners, well-wishers and friends-of-the-needy. We cudgel them to graciously lend us a hand by supporting our cause to enable us to serve God’s bits of wood.<br><br><strong>We think sometimes that poverty is only being hungry, naked, and homeless. The poverty of being unwanted, unloved, and uncared for is the greatest poverty. We must start in our own homes to remedy this kind of poverty.</strong><em>-Mother Theresa-</em>
